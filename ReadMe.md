LAYOUT CHOICE
Home page is separate from other web pages. Will be able to use the 
navigation bar to navigate back to homepage or other pages. I find this 
layout clean and effective. 
COLOR CHOICE
Gradient backdrop color scheme using rich dark colors like purple or blue 
gradually fading into something lighter cohesive colors. 
I believe this draws my audience's attention to where I want them to 
focus.
Colors also pair well with images of black people
I don't want a website too bright or too dark.
FONTS AND TYPOGRAPHY
Clear and easy-to-read font that is well spaced so the webpages are not 
cluttered and feel overwhelming
FUNCTIONALITY
Connectes a vast amount of people to relevant professionals and 
communities
Reminders audience of important events and their date with our calendar 
feature
TARGET AUDIENCE
My target is 17 and up black low-income people looking to kick start their 
career or pivot.
